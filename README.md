# cowin-vaccine-slot
Hunt for vaccination slots :P

covid.py : This is for testing purposes. So not use.

covid2.py : This is the one you want to run. Very formatted code, and gives proper output. (uses pin code as input)

covid3.py : Use this link, to get the district ids --> https://github.com/bhattbhavesh91/cowin-vaccination-slot-availability/blob/main/district_mapping.csv
            (uses district id as input)
